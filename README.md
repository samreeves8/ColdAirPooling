For our Senior Project at Western Colorado University, our dynamic team of three was entrusted with a formidable mission: the conception and execution of a cutting-edge Web Application 
tailored to the unique needs of a climate research group based in Gunnison, Colorado. Our web application primarily harnesses the power of PHP and JavaScript, ensuring seamless and robust 
functionality for the end-users. We have chosen to host our creation through HostGator for optimal reliability and performance. The backbone of our data management system is an SQL database, 
carefully engineered to handle and organize the vast repository of temperature data, totaling in the millions.

One of the key features we painstakingly designed and implemented is a seamless data uploading mechanism. With this feature, users can effortlessly upload CSV files containing 
their invaluable temperature data. Our system takes over from there, expertly parsing the files and diligently storing the data within a highly efficient relational database on the backend.

Additionally, we recognized the need for users to effortlessly query and explore this treasure trove of data. To address this need, we've fashioned a user-friendly data querying tool that empowers
users to swiftly locate the information they seek. But what truly sets our application apart is the fully automated data visualization component. Leveraging the power of JavaScript, 
we've enabled our users to gain a deeper understanding of their data through dynamic, real-time graphical representations. These automated data visualizations come in the form of 
interactive graphs, providing invaluable insights with just a few clicks.
